## [L-01] Misleading comments for protocol integrations

```solidity
File: SortedCdps.sol
134:     /// @notice Find a specific CDP for a given owner, indexed by it's place in the linked list relative to other Cdps owned by the same address
135:     /// @notice Reverts if the index exceeds the number of active Cdps owned by the given owner ðŸ‘ˆ
136:     /// @dev Intended for off-chain use, O(n) operation on size of SortedCdps linked list
137:     /// @param owner address of CDP owner
138:     /// @param index index of CDP, ordered by position in linked list relative to Cdps of the same owner
139:     /// @return CDP Id if found
140:     function cdpOfOwnerByIndex(
```

The comment `Reverts if the index exceeds the number of active Cdps owned by the given owner` is not correct. If the index exceeds the number of active Cdps owned by the given owner, the function returns `dummyId` instead of reverting.

The only place where it is used is `LeverageMacroBase` and there are checks in place to ensure that the CDP is valid, but it is recommended either updating natspec or adding a require statement to avoid wrong assumptions in future integrations.
