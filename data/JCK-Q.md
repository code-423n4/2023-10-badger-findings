## [L-01] Use of transfer instead of safeTransfer

It is good to add a require statement that checks the return value of token transfers, or to use something like OpenZeppelin's safeTransfer/safeTransferFrom, even if one is sure that the given token reverts in case of a failure.

This reduces the risk to zero even if these contracts are upgreadable, and it also helps with security reviews, as the auditor will not have to check this specific edge case.

## [Lâ€‘02] Use descriptive constant instead of 0 as a parameter

Passing 0 or 0x0 as a function argument can sometimes result in a security issue(e.g. passing zero as the slippage parameter). A historical example is the infamous 0x0 address bug where numerous tokens were lost. This happens because 0 can be interpreted as an uninitialized address, leading to transfers to the 0x0 address, effectively burning tokens. Moreover, 0 as a denominator in division operations would cause a runtime exception. It's also often indicative of a logical error in the caller's code.

Consider using a constant variable with a descriptive name, so it's clear that the argument is intentionally being used, and for the right reasons.

```solidity

209   _adjustCdpInternal(_cdpId, 0, 0, false, _upperHint, _lowerHint, _stEthBalanceIncrease);

## [L-04] Constant array index within iteration

Using constant array indexes within for loops is error prone as typically [i] is used instead as by using a constant index such as [0] means that only one value will be used/modified within an array, historically many bugs have been introduced through using a constant index rather than the array iteration index i.e i,j. Provided this is intentional and not a typo consider using enum values to make this distinction clear.

```solidity
file:  main/packages/contracts/contracts/CdpManager.sol

502   require(_toRemoveIds[0] == _start, "CdpManager: batchRemoveSortedCdpIds check start error");

## [L-05] payable function does not transfer ETH

The following functions can be called by any user, who may also send some funds by mistake. In that case, those funds will be lost.

There is 2 instance of this issue.

```solidity
file: main/packages/contracts/contracts/SimplifiedDiamondLike.sol

160  receive() external payable {
        // PHP is my favourite language
    }

164   fallback() external payable {
        _fallback();

## [L-06] Functions calling contracts with transfer hooks are missing reentrancy guards

Even if the function follows the best practice of check-effects-interaction, not using a reentrancy guard when there may be transfer hooks will open the users of this protocol up to read-only reentrancies with no way to protect against it, except by block-listing the whole protocol.

There is 1 instance of this issue.

```solidity
file: main/packages/contracts/contracts/LeverageMacroBase.sol

234   function sweepToken(address token, uint256 amount) public {
        _assertOwner();

        IERC20(token).safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);

## [L-07] Subtraction may underflow if multiplication is too large

The following expressions may underflow, as the subtrahend could be greater than the minuend in case the former is multiplied by a large number.

There are 3 instances of this issue.

## [L-08] Use of abi.encodePacked with dynamic types inside keccak256

abi.encodePacked should not be used with dynamic types when passing the result to a hash function such as keccak256. Use abi.encode instead, which will pad items to 32 bytes, to prevent any hash collisions.

There is 1 instance of this issue.

```solidity

## [L-09] Loss of precision on division

Solidity doesn't support fractions, so divisions by large numbers could result in the quotient being zero.

To avoid this, it's recommended to require a minimum numerator amount to ensure that it is always greater than the denominator.

## [L-16] Return values of approve not checked

Not all IERC20 implementations (e.g. USDT, KNC) revert when there's a failure in approve. The function signature has a boolean return value and they indicate errors that way instead.

By not checking the return value, operations that should have marked as failed, may potentially go through without actually approving anything.

There is 6 instance of this issue.

```solidity
file:  main/packages/contracts/contracts/LeverageMacroReference.sol

39      ebtcToken.approve(_borrowerOperationsAddress, type(uint256).max);

40      stETH.approve(_borrowerOperationsAddress, type(uint256).max);

41      stETH.approve(_activePool, type(uint256).max);

53      ebtcToken.approve(address(borrowerOperations), type(uint256).max);

54      stETH.approve(address(borrowerOperations), type(uint256).max);

55      stETH.approve(address(activePool), type(uint256).max);

## [Lâ€‘17] Use of ecrecover is susceptible to signature malleability

The built-in EVM precompile ecrecover is susceptible to signature malleability, which could lead to replay attacks. References: https://swcregistry.io/docs/SWC-117, https://swcregistry.io/docs/SWC-121, and https://medium.com/cryptronics/signature-replay-vulnerabilities-in-smart-contracts-3b6f7596df57.

While this is not immediately exploitable, this may become a vulnerability if used elsewhere.

There is 2 instance:

```solidity
file: main/packages/contracts/contracts/BorrowerOperations.sol

733  address recoveredAddress = ecrecover(digest, v, r, s);

```

## [Lâ€‘18] Missing zero address check in initializer

There are 2 instances (click to show):

```solidity

905    function initializeCdp(
        bytes32 _cdpId,
        uint256 _debt,
        uint256 _coll,
        uint256 _liquidatorRewardShares,

## [Lâ€‘19] Named return variable used before assignment

As no value is written to the variable, the default value is always read. This is usually due to a bug in the code logic that causes an invalid value to be used.

```solidity
file: main/packages/contracts/contracts/CdpManager.sol

233   return singleRedemption;

```

## [Lâ€‘20] Revert on transfer to the zero address

It's good practice to revert a token transfer transaction if the recipient's address is the zero address. This can prevent unintentional transfers to the zero address due to accidental operations or programming errors. Many token contracts implement such a safeguard, such as OpenZeppelin - ERC20, OpenZeppelin - ERC721.

There are 2 instances:


```solidity
file: main/packages/contracts/contracts/CdpManager.sol

283   collateral.transferFrom(address(receiver), address(this), amountWithFee);

```

```solidity

1100  ebtcToken.transferFrom(address(receiver), feeRecipientAddress, fee + amount);

```
